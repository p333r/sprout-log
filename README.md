# Sprout-app

A simple app for tracking your sprouts journey from seed to harvest. In development.

Buildt with:
- Node.js / Express
- DynamoDB (Cyclic.sh)
- Passport
- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery
- Bootstrap

Thinking about building the frontend in Svelte or React in the future, and maybe get rid of bootstrap for a smaller size.
